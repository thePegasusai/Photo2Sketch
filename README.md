# Photo2Sketch
Google Colab For turning images, to waterpainting/sketches. Dataset can be replaced with your own photos.
If you desire to run this model on your own data, you'll need to replace the sklearn import in the first cell , with the path to the dataset/folder of your choice as this is where our pictures are drawn from.
